## Winding-number scalograms: phase-locked spectral analysis on a
## non-monotone manifold

Consider a scalar climate record x(t) and a known latent phase coordinate
F(t) — the tidal forcing manifold of the Laplace's Tidal Equation (LTE)
framework, calibrated against the measured Earth rotation RATE d(LOD)/dt:
the annual-impulse convolution that builds the manifold integrates the
tidal torque into angular momentum (observed as LOD) by conservation of
angular momentum, so the calibration target is the rate and integrating
the fitted response reconstructs the LOD level at r ≈ 0.8. The calibration
is a regression of the manifold's constituent amplitudes/phases on
measured dLOD/dt: in-sample |r| > 0.99; split-sample out-of-sample
r ≈ 0.55–0.61 on the 52-year annual record — real but moderate predictive
skill, not an a-priori astronomical prediction. Crucially the regression
target is Earth rotation, never any climate index. A dynamical component "winds" around this manifold at
integer or fractional wave-number M if it contributes
A sin(2*pi*M*F(t) + phi) to the record. Because F(t) is non-monotone — it
reverses direction hundreds of times per century of monthly sampling and
is uncorrelated with any linear clock (linear-fit R^2 = 0.02) — calendar
time and winding "time" are incommensurate clocks, and no reparameterized
wavelet or Fourier transform on t can substitute for the winding axis.

We therefore compute the winding scalogram

    G(t0, M) = < w(t - t0) x(t) exp(-i 2*pi*M*F(t)) >,

a Gaussian-windowed correlation of the record against the manifold's own
native basis, localized in time t0. This is the fixed-manifold,
time-localized analogue of two established techniques. In rotating-machinery
diagnostics, computed order tracking (Fyfe & Munill 1977; Fyfe, Fritzen &
Rand 1997) resolves vibration spectra against shaft angle rather than time,
removing speed-fluctuation smearing; classical implementations resample the
signal at constant angular increments, which presupposes a monotone phase.
When the reference phase is non-monotone and multiply periodic — as for a
tidal manifold built from Doodson arguments (s, h, p, N) — resampling is
undefined and direct projection onto exp(-i 2*pi*M*F) is required, which is
what G(t0, M) performs. In experimental physics, lock-in (phase-sensitive)
demodulation measures amplitude and phase at a known drive phase; winding
scalograms generalize this in two directions: to a continuum of
simultaneous "orders" M, and to time-localized windows, yielding ridge
structures — persistent, sharp ridges in (t0, M) — as the signature of
genuine phase locking rather than incidental correlation. The closest
climate-domain ancestor is classical tidal harmonic analysis (Doodson 1928),
which regresses against known astronomical arguments but globally in time;
the scalogram's windowed form makes non-stationarity of the locked components
visible, and the surrogately-normalized power (log2 |G|^2 divided by an
AR(1)-matched noise floor through the identical basis) calibrates
significance against persistence, not white noise.

Applied to spatially distributed records, the procedure inverts the
conventional dimension-reduction order. EOF/PCA analysis diagonalizes the
temporal covariance and reports whatever directions maximize variance —
an assumption-free-in-form but assumption-laden-in-fact basis, since
empirical modes of non-stationary or phase-modulated oscillations split and
mix across several unrelated EOFs. A systematic sweep over sampling boxes
(lat, lon) — e.g. gridded Kaplan SST V2 or NCEP Reanalysis extracts — and
over M instead yields a continuum: for each geographic point, a ranked set
of winding numbers with amplitude, phase, and persistence statistics,
defined relative to a single externally calibrated clock. Structure is read
off directly — dominant winding versus multi-mode spread, inter-index
frequency locks, near-degenerate beat pairs — as coordinates with physical
meaning fixed a priori, rather than variance-ordered mixtures re-derived
separately for every dataset.

## One-paragraph condensed version

Winding-number scalograms measure how strongly a climate record contains
components phase-locked to a known, externally calibrated manifold F(t):
G(t0,M) = <w(t-t0) x(t) exp(-i 2 pi M F(t))>, a windowed correlation against
the manifold's native basis. Mathematically the technique is a fixed-manifold
generalization of computed order tracking (Fyfe et al. 1977, 1997) and lock-in
demodulation to a non-monotone, multiply periodic phase reference — the
turbine-shaft-angle resampling of classical order tracking is undefined for
such a clock, so direct projection is used — and of Doodson tidal harmonic
analysis, made time-local and surrogate-calibrated (AR(1) noise floor through
the identical basis). Sharp, persistent (t0,M) ridges then separate
non-autonomous, forcing-locked dynamics from autonomous (internally generated)
variability — a discrimination that variance-maximizing decompositions such as
EOF/PCA cannot make, since their basis is re-derived per dataset and has no
reference clock to be locked or un-locked to.

## Lineage and ancestry: the Doodson arguments, and the inverted operation

The winding-number scalogram sits on a pedigree older than any of the
signal-processing ancestors above. In 1921 Doodson expanded the
tide-generating potential into 38 primary constituents whose phases are
linear combinations of five fundamental astronomical arguments — Moon's
mean longitude (s), Sun's (h), lunar perigee (p), lunar node (N), and
solar perigee (p1) — codified as the Doodson numbers that still name every
tidal constituent today (Mm, Mf, M2, S2, N2, K1…). In 1928 Doodson
published the *reduction method*: tables allowing the tides to be removed
from monthly mean sea level, developed for the international geodetic
sea-level program that founded PSMSL the same year — a program built on
precisely the kind of multi-gauge monthly MSL composites analyzed here.
For a century, the discipline's use of these arguments has run in one
direction: tidal terms are *nuisance, subtracted from MSL* so that
"climate" (or geodesy, or land uplift) can be studied in what remains.

The baltic index turns the operation around, and that inversion is the
historically intuitive headline. `baltic` is a PSMSL composite of 211
coastal gauge sites (ID code 10006); averaging the basin suppresses
site-specific, instrumental, and short-period noise, and what survives —
per the scalogram survey above — is one dominant, sharp, whole-record ridge
at M = 1.2454 = **6.00 x 0.2076**, the exact order-6 harmonic of the same
base winding frequency independently converged on by six other basins
(6.7 bits over the AR(1) null, FWHM 0.06, continuity 1.00). That is:
non-tidal sea level of the Baltic, after everything classical reduction
would strip away, is *built from* the Doodson manifold — windings at
integer harmonics of a frequency calibrated against measured dLOD. The
predictive claim follows in the generative direction: an MSL time series
synthesized from the calibrated forcing alone (LTE Model vs baltic data
CC = 0.70 on the survey CV window — the ridge finding is solid; the
full-fidelity generation claim should be stated at this strength, not
beyond it).

"Conceivable in 1925" is therefore nearly true, and the near-miss is
instructive: Doodson had the arguments, the Baltic gauge networks, the
composite means. What the era lacked was (i) the measured dLOD record to
calibrate the manifold against a *known answer* rather than assume it,
(ii) the non-autonomous framing — classical harmonic analysis presumes
stationary constants over the analysis window, and 18.6-yr/8.85-yr
precession terms enter as constituents in their own right, whereas here
they emerge as beating *modulations* of the fast Mm/Mf windings against
the annual cycle, and (iii) the regression machinery to search a
continuum of winding numbers rather than a fixed constituent library.
Item (iii) was computationally hard in 1925; items (i) and (ii) were
conceptional, which is why the inversion took a century.

## Notes for Paul — positioning the EOF/PCA contrast honestly

The claim above is defensible as written; two cautions to keep it so:

1. Don't say EOFs are "blind" or "wrong" — say they answer a different
   question. EOF/PCA asks "which directions maximize variance?" Winding
   scalograms ask "which components are phase-locked to a calibrated
   external clock, where and when?" A non-stationary locked oscillation
   genuinely does smear across several EOFs (well documented — e.g. ENSO
   modes distributed across EOF pairs), so the two answers legitimately
   differ; the winding answer has the advantage that its coordinates are
   fixed a priori and comparable across datasets and sites without
   re-derivation. That last property is what makes the geospatial winding
   continuum (your M(lat,lon) field) possible in a way an EOF map is not:
   EOF labels only mean something within the dataset that produced them.

2. Anticipate the obvious reviewer question: "the manifold must be right."
   Answer is already in hand — dLOD-rate calibration (an independent
   validation target with a known physical answer — Earth rotation —
   never a climate index; in-sample r>0.99, honest out-of-sample
   ~0.55-0.61, level reconstruction by integration r~0.8), the fixed cross-index
   manifold (r = 0.9995 between indices), the IAAFT surrogate rejection
   (no ridge for arbitrary series), and the wavenumber-0 QBO contrast.
   State those as the method's falsification battery; the surrogate
   rejection is the strongest single card because it shows the instrument
   can answer "no."
